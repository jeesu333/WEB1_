<h2>Alport syndrome</h2>

Alport syndrome is a disease that damages the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys. It can lead to kidney disease and kidney failure. It can also cause hearing loss and problems within the eyes.  Alport syndrome causes damage to your kidneys by attacking the glomeruli. Glomeruli are the tiny filtering units inside your kidneys.
